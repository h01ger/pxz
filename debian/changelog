  [ Bartlomiej Wrobel ]
  * Initial release. (Closes: #655185)

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * Polish Bartlomiej's packaging: extend package description and incl.
    homepage and vcs-headers, bump standards version, fix debian/copyright, 
    bump compat level to get hardened build for free.
  * Remove Bartlomiej from maintainers in debian/control as his email address
    bounces. I'd be happy to co-maintain with him, but this needs a working
    email address.
