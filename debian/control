Description: parallel LZMA compressor using liblzma
 Parallel XZ is a compression utility that takes advantage of running LZMA
 compression of different parts of an input file on multiple cores and 
 processors simultaneously. Its primary goal is to utilize all resources to 
 speed up compression time with minimal possible influence on compression 
 ratio.
